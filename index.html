            <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <p>Dear Partners,</p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the second edition of the HMH BEYOND HOSPITALITY Newsletter. As we look back at what we have achieved in recent
                    months, we are delighted to share some of the exciting growth and ESG? initiatives from the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022.
                    We continue to seek new ways to create value for our stakeholders, associates, and guests, from our new partnership with Royal
                    Jordanian Airlines, offering Royal Club Award Miles to members staying in our hotels throughout the UAE and Jordan, to the launch
                    of Cvent business listing and dynamic bar direct connectivity with key travel partners.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the same time, we continue to be mindful of our collective responsibility for sustainable growth.<br/>
                    The health and safety of our guests, customers and colleagues is always our top priority. Our commitment to health and safety training
                    has been a key driver for our ability to deliver internationally recognized standards and best practices throughout our hotels.
                    Launched in March 2021, Hospitality Management Holding (HMH)’s ‘Be Green, Go Green’ initiative has empowered our teams to take
                    positive action in their local communities, from tree planting and beach cleaning to plastic bottle and waste recycling. We thank our
                    entire talented workforce for the dedication and hard work that we see every day, and we are immensely proud of the ways they have
                    stepped up to overcome difficult times and still care for each other and our guests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are excited to enter the last quarter of 2022 with such a great foundation for growth, as we enter a resurgence in the travel and
                    tourism industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would love to hear from you, and would welcome your input, article, or story for the next newsletter edition.
                    With your help and support, we look forward to continuing to deliver hospitality excellence.
                </p>
